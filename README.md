# RAG-based-Question-Generator-using-HuggingFace-and-FAISS
This project demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that generates questions from PDFs using HuggingFace models and FAISS for efficient document retrieval. The application takes 5-10 PDFs as input, extracts text, retrieves relevant sections based on user queries, and generates questions using a pre-trained HuggingFace model.
